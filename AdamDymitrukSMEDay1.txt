P&P CQRS Guidence

Projects have been cancelled/postponed after exploration in the past. The only one was Data Access due to lack of interest. This happened after the Vote of no Confidence.
Project sample domain is Conference Organization
Home Base: Git Hub â€“ how to use

How much of any of these: CQRS with ES/DDD?
Not for the novice developer. New to CQRS but not to programming.
Need a very concise version of DDD concepts.

Order of importance in DDD
	Bounded Context
	the rest in not prioritized

Backlog grooming of the example domain will be done in the next week.
Put complex behaviour at the beginning

LUNCH: Excellent pizza!

Bounded contexts have been defined.

Entry point of the system is out of scope. Straight to the landing page of the event.

Registration minutia of details was skipped.

Trying to find a complex enough workflow/saga.

Community suggestions:
	Manual override. Give away codes for bulk purchase after negotiation.
	Facebook integration
	Hotel integration.
	Dynamic room allocation based on interest.

Discounts and discount codes are being looked at. Interesting scenarios are coming out of cancellations and partial cancellations.

Mechanics of buying
	PayPal
	Direct

Grigori got back from doctor's. He managed to fracture his foot earlier in the week. :(

Looking at a calculator for costs of conference.
	Stealing form Heroku calculator and azure cost calculator.

Dropping taxes out of the cost calculation. Will be lumped into "fees".

Before getting to the shopping cart, whether the group registration is supported should be known.
As an individual, I don't care about tickets. As an HR person, I need the idea of tickets.
